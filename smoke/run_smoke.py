"""Deterministic, no-AI multi-transport MCP smoke test for remarkable-mcp.

This is the "first port of call" diagnostic: it drives the *real* MCP server over
the protocol (stdio, via the official ``mcp`` client SDK -- no AI, no models, no
mocks) and exercises EVERY available tool in EVERY available transport, in the
order:

    cloud  ->  usb-web  ->  ssh

Why that order matters: pushing files over SSH can reset the USB web interface,
so SSH (the only mode that writes to the device filesystem) runs LAST, after the
USB-web checks are done.

The server HIDES tools a transport cannot support (e.g. mkdir/move/rename/delete
are not registered over USB web; remarkable_author is SSH-only). The harness is
therefore ``tools/list``-driven: it asks each running server which tools it
actually exposes and only exercises those. Any tool in the master list that a
mode does not expose is reported as N/A for that mode -- which is the *correct*
behaviour, not a failure.

Each (mode, tool) cell is classified as one of:

    PASS  the tool ran and returned a sensible result for this transport
    N/A   the transport does not expose this tool (correctly hidden)
    SKIP  could not run (mode unavailable, or no target document to read)
    FAIL  the tool is exposed but errored or returned the wrong thing

A mode whose transport is not reachable (no cloud token, device unplugged, SSH
off) is reported as *unavailable* and all of its tools are SKIPped -- so a user
who only has one mode still gets a clean report for that mode.

Writes are confined to a unique per-run folder and cleaned up afterwards. Run
with ``--read-only`` to skip all write tools (pure connectivity/read check).

Usage:
    uv run python smoke/run_smoke.py                  # all available modes
    uv run python smoke/run_smoke.py --modes cloud    # one mode
    uv run python smoke/run_smoke.py --read-only      # no writes
